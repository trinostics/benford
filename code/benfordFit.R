# An old-fashioned rule of thumb is that the X2 approximation 
# for X2 and G2 works well provided that n is large enough 
# to have Ej = npj â‰¥ 5 for every j. 
# Nowadays, most agree that we can have Ej< 5 for 
# some of the cells (say, 20% of them). 
# Some of the Ej's can be as small as 2, 
# but none of them should fall below 1. 
# If this happens, then the X2 approximation 
# isn't appropriate, and the test results are not reliable.
